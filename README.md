# fractal-metalsmith-starter
A starting point to create a SSG built off of a Fractal pattern library

## The idea
I'm working on an interesting project combining Fractal and Metalsmith, where Metalsmith does nothing except gather data from markdown files and then renders it through twig templates that I build in fractal.

The idea being that the src files (all in markdown) and the design system (in twig) could be ingested and rendered by any SSG that can read the src and template files.

## Why this repo
This repo is a starting point for getting both Metalsmith and Fractal to work nicely with a single set of twig template files. Hoping to get it out in the open, add some features, and work out some best practices.
