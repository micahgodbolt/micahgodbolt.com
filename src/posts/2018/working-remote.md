A few days ago I saw a tweet asking about whether or not working remote was a good idea for junior level developers, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. I've been working remotely for a majority of my career, from junior level to senior level, and I feel I had a few things to share about how I've been able to make it successful.

## Support Networks

So you want to go remote? I don't care if you are a junior or senior dev, the first question I'd ask is "who is your support network?" If your answer is "my coworkers" I would caution you from working remote with a team that wasn't already 100% remote. If your answer is "I have a great network of peers that I connect with via Twitter, Slack, conferences and other non-work related spaces" I'd say you have a much better chance of succeeding at working remotely, even if many of your co-workers do not.

Working remotely can be lonely without co-workers walking past your desk throughout the day, inviting you to lunch, or asking about your weekend. If this is your usual "network", you'll lose a good bit of that going remote. The only way for a company to really capture this level of camaraderie is for the company to be 100% remote. That is why if you are connected with supportive, helpful peers via Twitter, FaceBook, Slack or other channels, you have your 'remote' group of co-workers to connect with. 

## Can Junior Devs Succeed Remotely

I had a few years of small agency work under my belt before starting a stretch of 4 years going remote, but I was pretty green when I started at Lullabot, and I definitely benefited from the fact that this team was completely remote. This was my first experience with version control, or clients that didn't sell yogurt, so I had a ton to learn, and I had to do so without having met a single person from the company in person. 

The reason this actually works is that if you work remotely, you've already invested in a workable set of headphones, and are comfortable jumping into a video call. If you work with a remote friendly company, all of your co-workers are similarly equipped. Working for a large, non remote friendly like Microsoft, this is certainly not always the case! I'm always running into co-workers that simply don't have a microphone, or aren't in an environment to take a call, or decide that skype running on a laptop in the middle of a room of 20 people is sufficient for the remote callers to participate.

You get the idea...as a junior dev, you need to make sure you have a team that understands the needs of remote workers, and is there willing to support them. In my years working with Red Hat, they were incredibly remote friendly! Every conference room had a great AV setup. Many people worked from home a few days a week and were among the remote callers, and everyone, I mean EVERYONE had a decent set of headphones at their desk to take a call. Another random thing that Red Hat HQ had that I was baffled to see...or hear missing from Microsoft offices was solid white noise! No, not the kind of white noise to put someone to sleep, but think about how it feels to be having a lively conversation in the office just as the air conditioning/heating turns off................


dead silence.........


awkward!.....

With consistent white noise filling the office, you could hold a normal volume conversation sitting at your desk, and the person in the cube next to could barely hear a word. All of these things made being a remote employee at Red Hat an incredibly good experience.

## Facetime

Continuing my praise for working remotely at Red Hat, the other thing that they nailed was the value of facetime....like real face to face time. Typically once every 3 months I would fly out to Raleigh to spend a week in the Red Hat tower, meeting with co-workers, pitching new ideas to managers, and having a great time hitting arcades, eating empanadas, fried chicken and other various southern cooking. This cadence was essential in fostering friendships, developing new ideas, and setting the stage for the next 3 months of work. 

I loved these visits! But that doesn't mean I wanted to relocate there. It was because it only happened once every few months that this time was so valuable. My experience at Lullabot was exactly the same. Everyone was remote, but a few times a year we'd all get together and harness the energy we got from finally being in the same room together into new ideas, new ambitions, new plans for the upcoming year. 

Too much facetime (working in an office) devalues how amazing it is to spend time with your co-workers. Being remote means that being in the same zip code as the people you work with is reason to take advantage of every minute that you have for talks, lunches, drinks, games, laughs and (in the case of Lullabot) lots of hugs. 

## Other musings

A lot of people wonder how it's possible to work from home with all of those possible distractions. Personally, I've never been too worried by them. I typically embrace them. Walk my daughter to the bus? That's a win in my book. Make my son lunch? Another win. Talk with my wife about an upcoming field trip she wants to chaperone? I'm glad I was there for that! 

Despite the various distractions I face throughout the day, I also think of all of the distractions that I miss by not being in an office. Want my attention? Sorry, you can't walk into my office. You can email me or ping me on Teams. My entire work day is async. No one expects or demands my immediate attention. Sometimes I'll get a message that demands immediate attention, and I will drop what I'm doing to help them out, but that's my choice. 

Also, I really love working from a coffee shop for the morning or afternoon. Working remote doesn't always mean working from home. But if you are working from home, be sure to spend some time on your office. Yes, working from the kitchen table can be difficult with a busy household! But if you have a room where you can close the door, put on some headphones, and create some personal space....getting into the groove is easier than it is in the office.
