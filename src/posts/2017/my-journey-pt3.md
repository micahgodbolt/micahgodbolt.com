Having entered 2014 with a pink slip in my inbox, there's no way I could have imagined where I'd be today. How does one go from losing a junior position (64k/year) to landing a senior position at Microsoft ([level 64](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Microsoft-Level-64-Salaries-E1651_D_KO10,18.htm)) in the span of 2 1/2 years? There's part of me that wants to say the answer is "a ton of luck", but I think a better expression is "several great opportunities and the willingness to seize them". The first of those opportunities did not require much deliberation as, after 3 weeks of job hunting, I was offered am amazing position with a DC based Drupal agency. The next opportunity though, came much quicker than I expected. My first hour of employment was spent at a sprint retrospective with the client I'd be spending the next 2 1/2 years working with, and it was my willingness to seize _that_ opportunity that opened every other door.

## 2014 100k/Year

It was a pinch of being in the right place at the right time, and a dash of knowing the right people, but a few weeks before I was let go, my next job was already set in motion around me. It all started when a DC based compay called [Phase2](https://www.phase2technology.com/) bought a small Portland agency in order to start a branch in the middle of this growing tech scene. As it happened, I was good friends with one of the developers in that newly aquried team, and had been recording several of my [SassBites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC-1xSCBCIY) podcasts with his coworkers as the audience. So when they looked to expand their team at the start of 2014, I seemed to be a natural choice.

Typically at an agency of this type, a front-end developer like myself would be dropped into the latter half of a project and have around 6 weeks to take a stack of photoshop docs and turn them into a Drupal theme. This process would be rinsed and repeated until you either burn out, or get promoted to even more soul crushing work. Somehow I managed to avoid this cycle altogether and landed with one off the longest client engagements this company had ever seen. So there I was, day one of my employment at Phase2 and starting up my contract with [RedHat.com](http://www.redhat.com/). Little did I know that this would be day one out of 800 with the Red Fedoras.

## Building A Modern Resume

As I said in the opening paragraph, I didn't spend 2 1/2 years heads down, toiling away at the tasks in front of me until Microsoft scooped me up. Yes, my resume included a solid stretch of work at a respected company, but it was the way that I was able to leverage that period of work that benefited me the most. As I stood in front of a dozen Microsoft employees during my on campus interview, it was the following opportunities seized that had the greatest impact on the position they offered me.

### From Hired Help to Principle Developer 

I came into the RedHat project to help them launch a redesign of [RedHat.com](https://www.redhat.com). At the start of that year I was one of the dozens of Phase2 employees who worked on that codebase. But by the time the site launched in the fall, most of my co-workers had rolled off the project and I was the sole front-end developer on the project. I'm not sure if this meant I was Red Hat's most valuable front-end contractor, or Phase2's least valuable, but whatever the reason was, it opened up an amazing opportunity that I almost passed up.

Having established myself as a knowledgable front-end developer, one of the principle PMs asked me how modular our front-end codebase was, and how hard it would be to share parts of our design with other teams.
