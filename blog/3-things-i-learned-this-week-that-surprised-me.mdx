## Specificity and !important

I like using [twitter polls](https://twitter.com/micahgodbolt/status/1131626097349496833) to test people's assumptions around odd edge case CSS knowledge, so when I saw this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DailySpecificity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DailySpecificity</a><br><br>html`<br> &lt;dl&gt;<br> &lt;dt class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;...&lt;/dt&gt;<br> &lt;dd class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;...&lt;/dd&gt;<br> &lt;/dl&gt;<br>`<br><br>css`<br> dl &gt; dt.title {<br> color: hotpink !important;<br> }<br><br> dl &gt; dt {<br> color: rebeccapurple !important;<br> }<br>`<br><br>what color is the &lt;dt&gt;?</p>&mdash; Adam Argyle (@argyleink) <a href="https://twitter.com/argyleink/status/1182041480065536000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I decided to jump right on in!

My first guess was `hotpink` due to higher specificity of the selector, but then I thought about the `!important` tag being a big trump card for specificity, and how our initial assumptions are often wrong. So I guessed that `!important` basically blew away all specificity, and without specificity, all that was left was the cascade. 

So `rebeccapurple` it was! I outsmarted the poll!

Except that I was wrong...

The answer actually was `hotpink`.

### Why?

In the past, you've probably seen specificity written like this:

```scss
#someID .myClass.myOtherClass a { color: green } 
/* 1 - 2 - 1 */

ul li div.linkClass span #anchorID  { color : red } 
/* 1 - 1 - 4  */
```
If both selectors match the anchor tag, the color will be `green` because the first slot is the same (1) but the second slot is higher for `green`. In this case, the 3rd slot doesn't even matter. 

So enter the !important declaration! So what exactly does that do? Lets look:

```
dl > dt.title { color: hotpink !important }
/* ! - id - class - tag  */
/* 1 - 0  - 1     - 2  */

/* vs */

dl > dt { color: rebeccapurple !important }
/* ! - id - class - tag  */
/* 1 - 0  - 1     - 1  */
```
So just like above, we go left to right until we find a higher value. 

- !important: `1 === 1` 
- id: `0 === 0`
- class: `1 === 1`
- tag: `1 < 2` winner `hotpink`!

### Conclusion

It turns out there was a 4th value in CSS specificity all along.

## Feeling productive at work bleeds into your personal life

In the past several months I've been struggling to find the passion and energy to dig into side projects, blog, read, watch tutorials, and just in general taking time to invest in myself. But in these past few weeks I've found myself feeling something I had not felt in a long time.

Recently I started spending more time at work writing code than dealing with the project management side of my job. My calendar opened up, my focus began to narrow on a smaller number of projects, and I finally found myself digging into multi hour blocks of work on projects that had sufficient clarity and done criteria. 

In other words: I got to focus on 3 scoped, completable projects, vs juggling 20 different initiatives with loose objectives, slippery timelines, and non-existent resources.

The result of this change was pretty drastic. I woke up ready to dive into work, I finished excited and energized, and when I thought about digging into an evening project the momentum of my day left me plenty of energy to get going.

### Conclusion

There are many things that influence your energy level: Age, sleep, exercise, diet, but don't forget to look at the energy work leaves you with. Sometimes it can suck you dry, and other times it can actually give you a boost! So strive hard to find that work that excites you and keeps you going. It'll leave you with energy and passion to keep learning, and keep getting better, and open up doors to do even more things that you love.
